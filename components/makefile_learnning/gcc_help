  -std=<standard>          Assume that the input sources are for <standard>.
  --sysroot=<directory>    Use <directory> as the root directory for headers
                           and libraries.
  -B <directory>           Add <directory> to the compiler's search paths.
  -v                       Display the programs invoked by the compiler.
  -###                     Like -v but options quoted and commands not executed.
  -E                       Preprocess only; do not compile, assemble or link.
  -S                       Compile only; do not assemble or link.
  -c                       Compile and assemble, but do not link=================================important========================
  -o <file>                Place the output into <file>. ====================================important==========================
  -pie                     Create a dynamically linked position independent
                           executable.
  -shared                  Create a shared library.
  -x <language>            Specify the language of the following input files.
                           Permissible languages include: c c++ assembler none
                           'none' means revert to the default behavior of
                           guessing the language based on the file's extension.
